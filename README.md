# Data Structures and Algorithms Practice In JAVA

Implementing Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) involves the creation and utilization of essential building blocks for efficient problem-solving in computer science and software development. Data structures are tools that enable the organization and manipulation of data, while algorithms are step-by-step procedures used to solve specific problems.
